## %>%

### Steps

Notice how each dplyr function takes a data frame as input and returns a data frame as output. This makes the functions easy to use in a step by step fashion. For example, you could:

1. Filter `spotify` to just Rap songs, then
2. Select the `loudness` and `energy` columns from the result

```{r echo = TRUE}
rap <- filter(spotify, genre == "Rap")
rap <- select(rap, loudness, energy)
rap
```

### Redundancy

The result shows us the loudest rap songs and their energy levels in our data set. But take a look at the code. Do you notice how we re-create `rap` at each step so we will have something to pass to the next step? This is an inefficient way to write R code.

You could avoid creating `rap` by nesting your functions inside of each other, but this creates code that is hard to read:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
select(filter(spotify, genre == "Rap"), loudness, energy)
```

The dplyr package provides a third way to write sequences of functions: the pipe.

### %>%

The pipe operator `%>%` performs an extremely simple task: it passes the result on its left into the first argument of the function on its right. Or put another way, `x %>% f(y)` is the same as `f(x, y)`. This piece of code punctuation makes it easy to write and read series of functions that are applied in a step by step way. For example, we can use the pipe to rewrite our code above:

```{r echo = TRUE}
spotify %>% 
  filter(genre == "Rap") %>% 
  select(loudness, energy)
```

As you read the code, pronounce `%>%` as "then". You'll notice that dplyr makes it easy to read pipes. Each function name is a verb, so our code resembles the statement, "Take spotify, _then_ filter it by genre, _then_ select the loudness and energy."

dplyr also makes it easy to write pipes. Each dplyr function returns a data frame that can be piped into another dplyr function, which will accept the data frame as its first argument. In fact, dplyr functions are written with pipes in mind: each function does one simple task. dplyr expects you to use pipes to combine these simple tasks to produce sophisticated results.

**Exercise 1**

We'll use pipes for the remainder of the tutorial. Let's practice a little by writing a new pipe. The pipe should:

1. Filter spotify to just the songs that are above 0.50 danceability
2. Select the `tempo` and `energy` columns

## Answers

**Exercise 1**

```{r}
spotify %>% 
  filter(danceability > 0.50) %>% 
  select(tempo, energy) 
```
